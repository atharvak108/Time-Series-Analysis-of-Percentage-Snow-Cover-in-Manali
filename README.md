# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Percentage-Snow-Cover-in-Manali

This project combined both my interests, time series and geo-spatial data. 
For data collection we used google earth engine, the code was such that the area ie. the image of a certain timeline was converted into ndsi value and then for that date the percentage cover of snow was calculated by just dividing the no of pixels in ndsi which are closer to 1 by the no of pixels which are closer to -1.

Thus time series data was collected and as shown in the code file and ppt, visualisations of trend, seasonality, error factor and even ACF and PACF plots were made before predicting future values using ARIMA AND SARIMA.
